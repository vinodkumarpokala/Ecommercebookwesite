sample website for testing

a basic full-stack web application using Python for the frontend (with a lightweight framework), backend (with Flask), and database (with SQLite).
**I. Database (SQLite)**
SQLite is a file-based database, so you don't need a separate server running. We'll define a table for storing book information.
# backend/database.py

**II. Backend (Flask)**
Create a folder structure for your backend (e.g., backend). Inside it, you'll have files like app.py and database.py (as above).
**1. backend/app.py (Flask application):**

**To run the backend:**
 * Create a folder named backend.
 * Save the database.py and app.py files inside the backend folder.
 * Open your terminal, navigate to the backend folder.
 * Install Flask and Flask-CORS: pip install Flask Flask-CORS
 * Run the Flask application: python app.py
   The server will typically start on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
III. Frontend (Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)
For a simple Python-only full-stack example, we can use basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with the Flask backend. Create a folder named frontend in the same directory as your backend folder.
**1. frontend/index.html:**

**2. frontend/style.css:**

**3. frontend/script.js:**

**To run the frontend:**
 * Create a folder named frontend in the same directory as your backend folder.
 * Save index.html, style.css, and script.js inside the frontend folder.
 * Open the frontend/index.html file in your web browser.
**How it works:**
 * Database (SQLite): The database.py script initializes and interacts with the books.db file.
 * Backend (Flask): The app.py script creates a Flask API with endpoints for:
   * GET /api/books: Fetching all books.
   * GET /api/books/<id>: Fetching a specific book.
   * POST /api/books: Creating a new book.
   * PUT /api/books/<id>: Updating an existing book.
   * DELETE /api/books/<id>: Deleting a book.
   * flask-cors is used to allow requests from the frontend (which runs on a different origin by default).
 * Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):
   * index.html: Provides the basic structure and forms for displaying, adding, and editing books.
   * style.css: Adds basic styling to the page.
   * script.js: Handles the dynamic behavior:
     * Fetches books from the Flask API on page load.
     * Displays the fetched books.
     * Handles form submissions for adding and updating books, sending data to the Flask API.
     * Handles deleting books via the Flask API.
This provides a basic full-stack application in Python. For more complex frontends, you would typically use a dedicated JavaScript framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js.
